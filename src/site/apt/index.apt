Java client for the RunDeck REST API

* What is it ?

  A Java librairie that maps the {{{http://rundeck.org}RunDeck}} HTTP REST API. RunDeck is an open-source tool for automating tasks on multiple nodes, with a CLI, a web-based interface and an HTTP REST API. You can read more about its API on the {{{http://rundeck.org/docs/RunDeck-Guide.html#rundeck-api}RunDeck User Manual}}. 

  This librairie has been extracted from the {{{http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/RunDeck+Plugin}Jenkins RunDeck plugin}}, so for the moment it is still incomplete (not all the RunDeck API is mapped). My goal is to have a complete mapping of the RunDeck API, and to publish the librairie on the {{{http://search.maven.org/}main maven repository}}, so that it can easily be used by Java ({{{http://maven.apache.org}Maven}}) and Groovy ({{{http://groovy.codehaus.org/Grape}Grape}}) developers. 

* What can I do with it ?

  * Use it in a Java application. A good example would be the {{{http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/RunDeck+Plugin}Jenkins RunDeck plugin}}, that needs to trigger RunDeck jobs from within the {{{http://jenkins-ci.org}Jenkins}} continuous-integration server.

  * Use it to write {{{./groovy.html}Groovy}} or {{{./jruby.html}JRuby}} scripts, for example if you want to automate the execution of RunDeck jobs based on external events.

* Where can I get more information ?

  * You can read the {{{./apidocs/index.html}API documentation}}

  * And the code is available on {{{https://github.com/vbehar/rundeck-api-java-client}GitHub}}
