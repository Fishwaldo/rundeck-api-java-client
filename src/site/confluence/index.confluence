h1. Java client for the RunDeck REST API

h2. What is it ?

A Java librairie that maps the [RunDeck|http://rundeck.org] HTTP REST API. RunDeck is an open-source tool for automating tasks on multiple nodes, with a CLI, a web-based interface and an HTTP REST API. You can read more about its API on the [RunDeck User Manual|http://rundeck.org/docs/RunDeck-Guide.html#rundeck-api].

This librairie has been extracted from the [Jenkins RunDeck plugin|http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/RunDeck+Plugin], so for the moment it is still incomplete (not all the RunDeck API is mapped). My goal is to have a complete mapping of the RunDeck API, and to publish the librairie on the [main Maven repository|http://search.maven.org/], so that it can easily be used by Java ([Maven|http://maven.apache.org]) and Groovy ([Grape|http://groovy.codehaus.org/Grape]) developers.

h2. What can I do with it ?

* Use it in a Java application. A good example would be the [Jenkins RunDeck plugin|http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/RunDeck+Plugin], that needs to trigger RunDeck jobs from within the [Jenkins|http://jenkins-ci.org] continuous-integration server.
* Use it to write [Groovy|./groovy.html] or [JRuby|./jruby.html] scripts, for example if you want to automate the execution of RunDeck jobs based on external events.

h2. Where can I get more information ?

* You can read the [API documentation|./apidocs/index.html].
* And the code is available on [GitHub|https://github.com/vbehar/rundeck-api-java-client].
